  <h1>Gap analysis checklist<br>
    Arabic &amp; Persian (Arabic script) for HTML/CSS
  (Draft)</h1>
<section>
<p>The W3C needs to make sure that the text layout and typographic needs of scripts and languages around the world are built in to technologies such as HTML, CSS, SVG, etc. so that Web pages and eBooks can look and behave as  people expect around the world.
</p>
<p>This page is a checklist of items to consider when investigating the level of support that is provided for a given script or language. If you want to raise an issue or comment against this page, use the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/typography/issues">github issues list</a>.</p>
<p>Each section starts with a prompt in italicised text, intended to help you think of things that might be addressed in that section. When summarising the situation, try to indicate which languages you are covering with your text. Use separate subheadings where there are divergent issues related to specific languages.</p>
<p>For each section element with a <code class="kw" translate="no">topic</code> class, add one of the following classes to that section tag. Then add any useful comments in the following section element with the <code class="kw" translate="no">details</code> class.<code class="kw" translate="no"></code></p>
<ul>
  <li>ok (no problems)</li>
  <li>na (not applicable)</li>
  <li>advanced (work needed to support advanced applications, such as fine quality book production)</li>
  <li>basic (work needed to support basic styling for basic web page use)</li>
  <li>broken (work needed to enable interoperable semantics, or basic display on the Web).</li>
</ul>

<p>For advanced typographic purposes, the fixed position of diacritical marks relative to base letter or baseline and the logical stacking behvaior of them might not be sufficient.

<h3 id="letter_spacing"><a href="#letter_spacing">Inter-character spacing</a></h3>
<p class="prompt">Many scripts create emphasis or other effects by spacing out the letters or syllables in a word. We know there are questions here about how this should work in Indic and SE Asian scripts, and in Arabic-based scripts.  Are there requirements for other scripts that we should add? (For justification related spacing, see below.) See 
<a href="../index#letter_spacing">available information</a> or <a href="https://github.com/w3c/i18n-activity/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Ainline-spacing%20label%3Atype-info-request">check for currently needed data</a>.</p>
</section>
<section class="details">
<p>It is very common in Arabic script to stretch words or phrases to a particular width (eg. to match a Latin translation or transcription above or below).  This is achieved by lengthening the connections between letters, and to some extent by use of wide glyph variants, etc. The rules for which part of the text to stretch and how far are complicated - this is not the even spacing that usually occurs in tracked Latin text. There are currently no mechanisms for managing this process effectively in HTML/CSS.</p>
