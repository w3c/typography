'boundaries': { 'status':'ok', "comments": `` },
'quotations': { 'status':'basic', "comments": `<p>In HTML and CSS the styling applied to nested multilingual quotations when using the q element chooses quotation marks based on the language of the text inside the quotation, rather than outside.</p>` },
'numbers': { 'status':'', "comments": `<p>Not yet clear whether there are issues related to the handling of arabic and eastern arabic script digits.</p>` },
'transforms': { 'status':'na', "comments": `<p></p>` },
'spacing': { 'status':'basic', "comments": `<p>It is very common in Arabic script to stretch words or phrases to a particular width (eg. to match a Latin translation or transcription above or below). This is achieved by lengthening the connections between letters, and to some extent by use of wide glyph variants, etc. The rules for which part of the text to stretch and how far are complicated - this is not the even spacing that usually occurs in tracked Latin text. There are currently no mechanisms for managing this process effectively in HTML/CSS.</p>` },
'ruby': { 'status':'na', "comments": `<p></p>` },
'textdecoration': { 'status':'basic', "comments": `<p>It must be possible to position under- and overlines further away from the baseline than for Latin text. There is not currently a way to achieve effective underlining in a way that works with the Arabic script.</p>` },
'emphasis': { 'status':'ok', "comments": `<p></p>` },
'bidi': { 'status':'basic', "comments": `<p>Edge still doesn't support directional isolation.</p>
<p>There are questions about how to transmit information about the expected directional behaviour of certain strings.</p>
<p>RLI, LRI, etc are still not well supported.</p>

'hyphenation': { 'status':'na', "comments": `<p>No hyphenation is used for Arabic when used with Arabic and Persian languages.</p>` },
'justification': { 'status':'advanced', "comments": `<p>Arabic script text uses various strategies for justification, which are different from say Latin script text. CSS doesn't provide any way to manage most of these behaviours. [Not sure whether to mark this a basic or advanced issue.]</p>` },
'counters': { 'status':'basic', "comments": `<p>Arabic script text uses local counter styles. While some of these are supported by some browsers, the set of symbols used and their order varies by language. Custom counter styles can be created using Firefox only. The CSS spec needs to become a Rec and more browsers need to support it.</p>` },
'initialletter': { 'status':'advanced', "comments": `<p>The parameters for managing initial-letter styling for the Arabic script are not well understood by the technology (for example, how to manage cursiveness across the boundary).</p>` },

'vertical': { 'status':'na', "comments": `<p>[We need to clarify whether there is a particular requirement for handling arabic text specially in vertical lines, such as upright glyphs.] [We are also waiting on implementation of sideways values of writing-modes in order to be able to effectively use arabic text in vertical arrangements (such as book spines, table headings, etc), but that is not a problem specific to arabic.]</p>` },
